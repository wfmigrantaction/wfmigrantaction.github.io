Waltham Forest Migrant Action is run primarily by volunteers, and we welcome contact from like-minded individuals who would like to get involved. 

Our need for volunteers changes over time, but if you would like to find out
more please email us at <a href="mailto:supportcentre@wfma.org.uk">supportcentre@wfma.org.uk</a> expressing your
interest.

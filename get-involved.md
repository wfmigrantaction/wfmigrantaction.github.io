#### Vacancy - Support Centre Manager

* **Hours** 10 hours per week including Friday mornings
* **Salary** Circa Â£7,800
* **Location** Walthamstow and working from home

Waltham Forest Migrant Action's Support Centre provides a warm
welcome to migrants, offering free welfare, housing and immigration
advice and casework, signposting to other services, administrative
support, such as form filling, liaising with official bodies and, as needed,
accompaniment to hearings or meetings. Volunteers are key to the
running of the Support Centre.

This new post will provide overall management of the Centre, including
coordinating the team of volunteers and advisers, administration, and
liaison with external bodies. An understanding of migrant issues, strong
organisational, interpersonal and communications skills and ability to work
with minimal supervision are essential. We particularly welcome applicants
with lived experience of migration and the UK immigration system.

* **Interviews** w/c 11 October 2021
* **Start date** ASAP

#### Vacancy - Advocate
Volunteer advocates at the Friday morning Support Centre welcome visitors, make tea and chat to them - as well as take their details and sit in with them during their time with the advisors. They then also perform any follow-up actions, including signposting to services such as food banks and health organisations, and assisting with form-filling. 

Advocates attend the Centre approximately once a month on a rota system. Full training is given.

#### Vacancy - Events Volunteer
Waltham Forest Migrant action is looking for an Events Volunter. WFMA runs a variety of events in the borough to raise money to cover the running costs of the Support Centre. Past events have included gigs, a Burns night dinner, and pub quizzes at the Rose and Crown. If you'd like to help organise and coordinate events like this (or maybe you have a few ideas of your own?) then please get in touch at [events@wfma.org.uk](events@wfma.org.uk).

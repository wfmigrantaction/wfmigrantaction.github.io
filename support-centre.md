Our weekly Support Centre offers our migrant visitors free advice on immigration, accommodation and welfare issues, as well as signposting to other organisations that can help. We also provide a warm welcome, tea and biscuits, and opportunities to socialise and practise speaking English.

Please note that **immigration advice is by appointment only**. To make an appointment, please visit the centre so we can take the details of your case and find an available time.

Our visitorsâ€™ needs and welfare are our top priority. We always do our best to help while respecting anonymity and listening without judgement in the strictest of confidence.

Our weekly Support Centre offers our migrant visitors free advice on immigration, accommodation and welfare issues, as well as signposting to other organisations that can help. We also provide a warm welcome, tea and biscuits, and opportunities to socialise and practise speaking English.

Please note that **immigration advice is by appointment only**. To make an appointment, please visit the centre so we can take the details of your case and find an available time.

Our visitors’ needs and welfare are our top priority. We always do our best to help while respecting anonymity and listening without judgement in the strictest of confidence.
